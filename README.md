# Wireless-sensor-network-using-Contiki-OS
This project will work on the Contiki-OS platform. Makefile should be included to compile and upload the program to the board.

The server and client communicate with each other to transfer temperature and humidity sensor values. The sensor values are then uploaded to AWS IoT using the python script.

The python script should be executing in background to allow the server to send the sensor values to AWS IoT.
